# PowerPlatform Issue Reporting Form
An automated solution built with Microsoft Forms, Power Automate, and SharePoint to streamline issue reporting and tracking for the regional Automation & Analytics team. 
The flow captures issue details, identifies the issuer and their manager, logs the data in a SharePoint list, handles attachments, and sends notifications via email and Teams. 
A secondary flow confirms resolution and closure, ensuring visibility and accountability for ad hoc tasks.


## Overview
As the Automation and Analytics team continues to expand its portfolio of projects, the frequency of day-to-day issues has also increased. These issues are often ad hoc in nature and can be overlooked or deprioritized by managers due to their informal reporting—typically via email or Teams messages. This results in delays in resolution and consumes valuable time that could be spent on ongoing development work.
To address this, a structured issue tracking system was needed—something that didn’t exist previously. The solution was to create an automated issue reporting and tracking mechanism using Power Platform tools.
Stakeholders:
The entire regional team that utilizes automation tools and analytics dashboards.
